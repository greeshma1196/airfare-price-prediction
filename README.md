Introduction

The cost of a flight ticket depends numerous factors. Airline companies use sophisticated approaches such as “Revenue Management” or “Yield Management” to increase the cost of a ticket. Some of the factors that affect the price are time of purchase, traffic on the website, number of seats left in a particular flight, carriers, distance and time of the year. Our goal is to analyze the factors that significantly affect flight fares and subsequently develop a prediction model to predict the average fare for a particular route. This is carried out by examining historical data over a period of 20 years.


Data Description

The dataset used for the analysis and prediction was extracted from U.S. Department of Transportation. The dataset has records of over 20 years and is categorized by 4 quadrants of the year. We have selected the relevant columns from the dataset for analyzing and predicting the average fare for a given route. The dataset has these following columns:

1.	Year: The year of travel on that route
2.	Quarter: The quarter of the year (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
3.	Origin: Origin city of the flight
4.	Destination: Destination city of the flight
5.	Average Fare: Average fares for that route
6.	Distance: Distance between origin city and destination city.
7.	carrier_lg: Carrier with largest market share in that route
8.	carrier_low: Carrier with the lowest fare in that route


Data Visualization & Prediction

Contains initial exploratory analysis and data pre-processing.


Conclusion

This model on Airfare Prediction will immensely help passengers in making the right decisions  in terms of air travel, especially in a world where we have so many choices.

This model can be further improved by integrating other factors that influence airfares like time of purchase of the ticket, volume of passenger traffic on that particular route etc. The performance of the model can also be enhanced by using complex deep learning strategies like Artificial Neural Networks. 
The entire Aviation industry has taken a massive hit due to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic. Thus, the application of this model could be extended to analyse the impact of the pandemic on flight fares and the aviation industry as a whole.
